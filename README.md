With unity mlagents the reinforcement learning is a fun thing to do. In this project my idea was to train an agent to fly a fighter aircraft and put a bomb on the identified target.
For this version I did not used more advanced aircraft physics just the basics to control an airplane.
First attempt failed because of some input controlls were messed up in the code and it's all fixed now.
Still some errors occuring when training related to the force of the aircraft when updating a frame .
Currently I'm trying to fix those issues so I can have a full training without any errors.
All the assets I've used are free on the unity assets store.
